PS C:\Windows\system32> Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
Set-ExecutionPolicy : Windows PowerShell updated your execution policy successfully, but the setting is overridden by a policy defined at a more specific 
scope.  Due to the override, your shell will retain its current effective execution policy of RemoteSigned. Type "Get-ExecutionPolicy -List" to view your 
execution policy settings. For more information please see "Get-Help Set-ExecutionPolicy".
